# How to Add or Remove Levels in the GitHub File

## Adding Levels
To give a player more levels:
1. Find their name in the file
2. Increase the number after their name
3. Example: Change `PlayerName - 100` to `PlayerName - 300` (gives 200 more levels)

## Removing Levels
To reduce a player's levels:
1. Find their name in the file 
2. Decrease the number after their name
3. Example: Change `PlayerName - 500` to `PlayerName - 200` (removes 300 levels)

## Setting Negative Limits
To force a player below their current level:
1. Add a minus sign to the number
2. Example: `PlayerName - -50` (they'll be kicked if they're 50 levels above their starting point)

Remember: No player can exceed level 1000 regardless of what's in the file.
